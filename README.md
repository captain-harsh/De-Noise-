# De(Noise)

The project aims to achieve speech enhancement. Speech enhancement is the task of taking a noisy speech input and producing an enhanced speech output using deep learning techniques. Initially we will use autoencoders then move onto implement SEGAN (1703.09452)

We have covered baiscs of python and git. We have also gone through an introductory ML course. Currently, we are covering the basics of TensorFlow and will be doing a detailed study of ResNet architecture after that
