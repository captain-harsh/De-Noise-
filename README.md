# Seasons of Code 2022

This repository is made for Seasons of Code 2022, by Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

## (De)Noise

### Week 0

In this week, I revised the Python basics and studied about Git and GitHub.

### Week 1

In this week, I did a crash course on Machine Learning by Google and learned the basics of Machine Learning.

### Week 2

In this week, I did a course on TensorFlow from Udacity and learned how to use TensorFlow for Deep Learning.
I also did a tutorial to understand the Resnet architecture. Then I did a YouTube series on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). There, I theoretically
understood the structure and functions of GANs.

### Week 3

In this week, I did a tutorial to implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch in Google Colab. GAN_Tutorial.ipynb contains the complete code of training and showing the performances of the models. I also completed Week 1 of the Coursera course on Sequence Models under Deep Learning Specialisation to understand Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

### Week 4

In this week, I implemented autoencoders for speech enhancement. Noise_Reduction_with_Autoencoders.ipynb contains the complete code of training the models and saving them to the mounted drive. NoiseSuppressionModel.h5 is the model saved in HDF5 format. TFLiteModel.tflite is the model saved in tflite format.

### Week 5

In this week, I studied the paper on SEGAN (Speech Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network) and began implementing the same.

### Week 6

In this week, I completed the implementation of SEGAN thus completing the project. The files related to SEGAN are present in the folder Final_Model.
